# Nobu Trip Tracker

Nobu Trip Tracker is a simple Python script that I made that allows me to keep track of my visits to Nobu in Palo Alto. 

## Features

- Add new Nobu trips with details (date, location, dishes, rating).
- View all recorded trips.
- Automatically save trips to a JSON file for persistence between sessions.
